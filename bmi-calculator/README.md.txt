# ⚖️ BMI Calculator

This Python script calculates my personal Body Mass Index (BMI) using my actual weight and height.

## 📍 Background

BMI is a number derived from a person’s weight and height. It’s used as a rough indicator of whether a person is underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese. While not a perfect measure, it’s a quick way to estimate body fat.

The formula is:

BMI = weight (kg) / height² (m²)


## 🔢 My Data
- **Weight**: 73 kg
- **Height**: 1.58496 m

## 📈 Output
```bash
python bmi.py
